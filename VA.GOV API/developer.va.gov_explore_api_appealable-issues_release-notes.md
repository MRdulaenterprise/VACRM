## Appealable Issues API

## July 15, 2025

## Introducing the Appealable Issues API!

**Version 0 of the Appealable Issues API is active and available for use.**

The Appealable Issues API lets you retrieve a claimant's previously decided (appealable) issues and any related prior issues. An "issue" is a problem listed in a VA claim, and a single claim may include multiple issues. Claimants may be Veterans or dependents of Veterans, such as spouses, children (biological and step), and parents (biological and foster).

This data helps you submit a Higher-Level Review, Notice of Disagreement, or Supplemental Claim. However, not all issues returned by the API may be eligible for appeal. If an issue is already under VA review—indicated by the `activeReview` field being 'true'—it should not be resubmitted, as this would create a duplicate Decision Review.

To check the status of all decision reviews or appeals for a specified individual, use the [Appeals Status API](https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/appeals-status).

To learn more, review the [Appealable Issues API v0 documentation](https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/appealable-issues/docs).
